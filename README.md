### Cases Analysis 
## Problem Statement:

The Ebola outbreak has posed significant challenges in terms of its spread and severity, highlighting the need to understand the underlying factors contributing to its occurrence. However, identifying and analyzing these factors can be complex due to the diverse nature of the data and the dynamic nature of the outbreak.

The problem at hand is to determine the key factors that contribute to the spread and severity of the Ebola outbreak. By identifying these factors, we can gain valuable insights into the determinants of the outbreak and develop informed strategies for prevention, preparedness, and response.

The specific challenges we aim to address include:

Understanding the patterns and characteristics of the Ebola outbreak: Analyzing the data to gain a deep understanding of the temporal and geographical patterns of the outbreak, the demographics of affected populations, and the impact of various factors on the outbreak's severity.

Identifying influential factors: Exploring a wide range of variables such as geographical location, demographics, healthcare infrastructure, interventions, and public health measures to determine their impact on the spread and severity of the outbreak.

Predicting future outbreak patterns: Developing predictive models that leverage historical data and incorporate relevant factors to forecast future outbreak patterns. This will enable proactive measures to be taken in terms of resource allocation, healthcare infrastructure planning, and targeted interventions.

Providing actionable insights: Deriving actionable insights from the analysis results to inform decision-making by public health organizations and policymakers. These insights will aid in enhancing outbreak preparedness, response strategies, and resource allocation, ultimately reducing the impact of future Ebola outbreaks.

By addressing these challenges, we aim to contribute to the field of epidemiology and provide evidence-based recommendations to mitigate the public health threat posed by Ebola outbreaks.

## Last Update 
As of the last update Tuesday 27 June 2023 

# Conclusion
Sierra Leone has the highest count of cumulative cases recorded All the top countries with high number of Ebola cases are fro Africa Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal

Monthly wise Cumulative number of confirmed, probable and suspected Ebola cases and Death have gradually increased over the month

from the month of June - september gradual number recorded were recorded

Year wise - in 2015 its when the highest record count of count and in 2016 report cases of Ebola dreases

In 2015 Cumulative number of confirmed Ebola cases and Cumulative number of confirmed, probable and suspected Ebola deaths were recorded 2208 records were recorded marking the highest count

# Next Steps
This Project needs more data to be able to understand the full spectrum of the Ebola Virus.

Population data,
geographical data,
healthcare system data.
